# Relist API Middleman

Host your own version of the Relist API

**NOTE:** As it does not get data directly from the database, rate limit is still enforced.

## Steps to self-host:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Copy it onto your computer.

3. Open folder in terminal and type:

```
npm install
```

4. Make sure to put a valid API URL.

Relist is not officially hosted. You can self-host the API and make your own bot listing site. You need to put the API URL in the `apiUrl` variable in the `index.js` file.

5. Finally, type:

```
node index
```
